#summary LOST Server GSM Interface.

= Introduction =

This page describe the interface to the GSM.
We use a Nokia 3330 has a modem.

It has many advantages:
 * Low Cost (20 dollars on Ebay).
 * Simple interface (UART 8bits).


= Details =
The phone is connected to the Ethernut board through the I/O board.
We use a RJ11 connector as it is really simple to connect and disconnect when needed.

Here is the connector pin-out:
 * TX : Ethernut transmit -> GSM receive.
 * RX : Ethernut receive <- GSM transmit.
 * 12V Power.
 * GND.

= Phone modification =
The phone has been modified in order to be connected to the Ethernut board.
Because of:
 * Power : no battery needed.
 * UART level adaptation : 5V (Ethernut) / 3.3V (GSM)

= Phone communication =
As we already said, the communication is done through the UART interface.

The protocol has been built by Nokia. It is called FBUS.
