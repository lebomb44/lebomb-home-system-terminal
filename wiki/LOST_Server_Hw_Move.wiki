#summary Movement detector interface.

= Introduction =

This interface detects when a contact to GND is opened.


= Details =

On each line, a diode 1N4001 has been added in order to protect the MCU against voltage overshot.
Normally, the line must be closed to GND.
If the line is opened, the MCU will detect it.
Of course the internal pull-up of the MCU line must be activated to detect this opening.
