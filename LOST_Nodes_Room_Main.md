# Details #

As explained in the main page, the node is linked to the Server through an [I2C bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C).

The node is fully stand alone as it has its own micro-controller.
The Board is organized around an [ATMega8L](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=2004).
